% This "mediaclass.config" file contains image resizer definitions.
% Each named mediaclass can be used as the 'mediaclass' argument for
% an image tag. For example
%
% {% image id mediaclass="small-crop" %}
%
% By using mediaclasses you can change image sizes, quality and other
% filters without changing your template code.
%
% Any module (or site) can have its own 'mediaclass.config' file. The
% usual priority overrides for modules, where a higher priority overrules
% any definitions made in a module with a lower priority (higher number
% is lower priority, 1 is highest priority).

% Below must be valid Erlang, if there is a parse error then the error
% will be logged by Zotonic and the definitions will not be used.
